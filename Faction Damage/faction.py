    Modded Damage = 100 × (1 + 1.65) × (1 + 0.3) = 344.5
    Tick damage = 0.35 × 344.5 × (1 + 0.3) = 156.7475

As can be seen in the above calculations for tick damage, Faction Damage is applied twice, making their effective bonus = (1+Faction Bonus)^2. Which is +69% for the 30% Faction Damage mods and +140.25% for the 55% Primed Faction Damage mods.
